# Tom Renard — Senior Product Engineer (Frontend)

<Lead>
  Bridging the gap between Technical Excellence, Product Strategy, and Business
  Growth.
</Lead>

I am a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Berlin with over 6 years of experience building high-performance, accessible web applications. Unlike traditional developers, I combine deep technical expertise in React, TypeScript, and Next.js with a Master's in Management. This allows me to not just implement features, but to challenge product requirements, optimize for user adoption, and drive measurable business ROI.

Currently, I am a Senior Engineer at [Doodle](https://doodle.com), where I lead large-scale architectural migrations and performance initiatives. I am obsessed with Core Web Vitals, having recently improved mobile performance scores by 97%.

I am also an advocate for AI-Native Engineering. I leverage tools like Copilot and Cursor to accelerate refactoring, validate architectural decisions, and ship bug-free code faster.
