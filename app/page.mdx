# Tom Renard

I am a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Berlin, building fast, accessible, and scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern frontend architecture. I combine technical expertise with a product and business perspective to deliver user-focused, high-impact solutions. I also leverage AI-assisted workflows to accelerate refactoring, validate architectural decisions, and streamline complex implementation.

Since my early career, I’ve worked on a mix of full-stack and frontend projects, from freelance web applications to enterprise SaaS platforms. I completed a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon in 2020 and have contributed to companies like Aklamio and Doodle, leading major frontend initiatives including Next.js migrations, performance optimization, and design system development.
